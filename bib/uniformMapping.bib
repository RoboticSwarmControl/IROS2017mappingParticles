	Abstract = {There are many examples of minimally invasive
surgery in which tethered robots are incapable of accurately reaching target locations deep inside the body either because
they are too large and result in tissue damage or because the
tortuosity of the path leads to loss of tip control. In these
situations, small untethered magnetically-powered robots may
hold the potential to act as delivery vehicles for therapeutic
agents. While MRI scanners provide a means to power, control
and image such robots as they move throughout the body, a
substantial challenge arises if the clinical application requires
more than one such robot. The resulting system is
underactuated and thus its controllability is in question. This
paper presents a simple motion planning algorithm for two
magnetic capsules and demonstrates through simulation and
experiment that nonlinear fluid damping can be exploited to
independently control the positions of the capsules.},

	Abstract = {We present control strategies that implement planar microassembly using groups of stress-engineered MEMS microrobots (MicroStressBots) controlled through a single global control signal. The global control signal couples the motion of the devices, causing the system to be highly underactuated. In order for the robots to assemble into arbitrary planar shapes despite the high degree of underactuation, it is desirable that each robot be independently maneuverable (independently controllable). To achieve independent control, we fabricated robots that behave (move) differently from one another in response to the same global control signal. We harnessed this differentiation to develop assembly control strategies, where the assembly goal is a desired geometric shape that can be obtained by connecting the chassis of individual robots. We derived and experimentally tested assembly plans that command some of the robots to make progress toward the goal, while other robots are constrained to remain in small circular trajectories (orbits) until it is their turn to move into the goal shape.Our control strategies were tested on systems of fabricated MicroStressBots. The robots are 240--280 µm × 60 µm × 7--20 µm in size and move simultaneously within a single operating environment. We demonstrated the feasibility of our control scheme by accurately assembling five different types of planar microstructures.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the Model Predictive Control (MPC) of magnetized Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis) using a magnetic field. The magnetized T. pyriformis are generated by feeding spherical iron oxide particles into the cells. Using an external magnetic field, we change the movement direction of the cell, but the speed of the cell remains constant regardless of the strength of the external magnetic field. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the discrete-time plant model of the magnetized cell is generated using the least-squares method. Second, using the model of each cell, they are controlled to follow a reference track by an external magnetic field with MPC. Third, by using a predictor-like scheme to execute the plant input before the measurement of the cell position, we successfully solve the image-processing delay problem in the feedback system. In our results, we show three comparisons between different control schemes and an initial tracking to prove the effectiveness of the control approach.},

	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is  difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.
 
In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.
 
In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models. 

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

In the absence of perturbation, the open-loop policy achieves zero error in finite time. In the pres- ence of perturbation, the closed-loop policy is globally asymptotically stabilizing with state feedback. Both policies were validated with hardware experiments using up to 15 robots. These experimental results suggest that similar policies might be applied to control micro- and nanoscale robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints.},

	Abstract = {Bacteria-inspired magnetic helical micro-/nanoswimmers can be actuated and steered in a fuel-free manner using a low-strength rotating magnetic field, generating remotely controlled 3D locomotion with high precision in a variety of biofluidic environments. They are therefore envisioned for biomedical applications related to targeted diagnosis and therapy. In this article, a porous hollow microswimmer possessing an outer shell aggregated by mesoporous spindle-like magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) and a helical-shaped inner cavity is proposed. The fabrication is straightforward via a cost-effective mass-production process of biotemplated synthesis using helical microorganisms. Here, Spirulina-based fabrication is demonstrated as an example. The fabricated microswimmers are superparamagnetic and exhibit low cytotoxicity. They are also capable of performing structural disassembly to form individual NPs using ultrasound when needed. For the first time in the literature of helical microswimmers, a porous hollow architecture is successfully constructed, achieving an ultrahigh specific surface area for surface functionalization and enabling diffusion-based cargo loading/release. Furthermore, experimental and analytical results indicate better swimming performance of the microswimmers than the existing non-hollow helical micromachines of comparable sizes and dimensions. These characteristics of the as-proposed microswimmers suggest a novel microrobotic tool with high loading capacity for targeted delivery of therapeutic/imaging agents in vitro and in vivo.},
