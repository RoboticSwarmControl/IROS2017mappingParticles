1)We present benchmarking algorithms for a novel approach towards mapping of tissue and vasculature based on moving and measuring magnetic particles that are commanded by a global uniform input such as an MRI. 
2)The red particles which represent the micro particles visit frontier cells in blue in order to cover them or explore them. All particles move a unit step in the same direction until stopped by the black obstacles in a given move.
We study the three related challenges: mapping, coverage and foraging  in 1D and 2D grid environments. 
3)For mapping a linear 1D space we show that the maximum and minimum number of moves can be bounded for single particle case.  
4)For mapping with n particles, we derive the equation for number of moves as a function of maximum interparticle distance gbar.   
5)We also examine mapping when scanning and moving have associated costs since in an MRI only  one can be done at a time.
6)For 2D grid maps, we provide 3 algorithms of increasing complexity:
 First, Random moves. a probabilistically complete algorithm where each move is random. 
7) Second, Elect particle. Path planning is made based on proximity of an elect particle in green, to it’s closest frontier cell which is blinking in green and blue. And 
8)finally the closest frontier algorithm where the proximity of a particle to a frontier cell is exploited. Here, planning is based on the closest  frontier cell and particle pair. This algorithm gives the shortest path of the three. 
To give a holistic idea about mapping with global inputs
9) we also discuss the optimal and worst case scenarios for our algorithms.
In the simulation analysis, we compare
10) The performance of the algorithms for different number of particles, 
11) Effects of Different distributions such as Region fill, Flood fill and Uniform fill, and finally 
12)different maps. Such as: Empty rectangle, 
13)H-tree map which has a large perimeter and 
14)also a complex map closely resembling vascular structures.
