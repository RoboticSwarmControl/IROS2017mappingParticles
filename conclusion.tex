This paper presented techniques for controlling particle swarms in 1D and 2D grids.
These particles can be tracked and controlled by an external agent, but control inputs are applied uniformly so that each particle experiences the same applied forces. 

We provided a spectrum of theoretical and practical new insights  with potential relevance for fast MRI scans with magnetically controlled contrast media.
In particular, we developed a fundamentally new approach 
for searching for an object at an unknown distance $D$, where the search is 
subject to two different and independent cost parameters
for {\em moving} and for {\em measuring}. 
We showed that regardless of the relative cost of these two operations,
there is a simple $O(\log D/\log\log D)$-competitive strategy.
This paper also presented benchmark algorithms for 2D mapping, foraging, and coverage problems.
These results form a baseline for future work, which should focus on improving performance. 
Extensions to 3D are especially relevant to the motivating problem of MR-scanning in living tissue.
