Mapping with Germany
This code uses the closestFrontier algorithm provided to map a known image-based maze using particle swarms in a global 2D matrix. More information on the efficiency and optimization can be read in the abstract and paper included in the folders. This branch corrects some errors and changed some settings to make the overall presentation better.
